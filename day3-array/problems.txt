1. Write a function that generates a range of numbers. The function should accept
   3 integers, from, to and step. The function should also have another variant
   which allows the user to only specify from and to with a default step value of 1.
   
   ex: range(1,10) => [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
       range(1,10,2) => [1,3,5,7,9]
       range(5,1,-1) => [5,4,3,2]

2. Write a function that repeats an integer n times.

   ex: repeat(5,2) => [2,2,2,2,2]
       repeat(3,1) => [1,1,1]

3. Write a function to find the largest number in an integer array.

4. Write a function to find the average of an integer array

5. Write a function to find if a given array is in strict ascending order.
   Each number should be greater than the previous number in the array. Return
   a boolean:

   ex: int[] numbers = {1,2,3}
       isAscending(numbers) => true 
       int[] numbers = {1,1,2}
       isAscending(numbers) => false

6. Write a function to find if two character arrays are equal. 

7. Write a function to concatenate two integer arrays

8. Write a function that returns a new array consisting of only non-zero values 
   from the original array. Do not modify the original array:

   ex: int[] numbers = {1,0,2,0,3};
       removeZeroes(numbers) => [1,2,3];
